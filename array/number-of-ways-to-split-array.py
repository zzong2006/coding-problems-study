number-of-ways-to-split-array

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n.

nums contains a valid split at index i if the following are true:

- The sum of the first `i + 1` elements is greater than or equal to the sum of the last `n - i - 1` elements.
- There is at least one element to the right of `i`. That is, `0 <= i < n - 1`.

Return the number of valid splits in nums.

Input: nums = [10,4,-8,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
There are three ways of splitting nums into two non-empty parts:
- Split nums at index 0. 
    Then, the first part is [10], and its sum is 10. 
    The second part is [4,-8,7], and its sum is 3. 
    Since 10 >= 3, i = 0 is a valid split.
- Split nums at index 1. 
    Then, the first part is [10,4], and its sum is 14. 
    The second part is [-8,7], and its sum is -1. 
    Since 14 >= -1, i = 1 is a valid split.
- Split nums at index 2. Then, the first part is [10,4,-8], and its sum is 6. The second part is [7], and its sum is 7. Since 6 < 7, i = 2 is not a valid split.
Thus, the number of valid splits in nums is 2.
