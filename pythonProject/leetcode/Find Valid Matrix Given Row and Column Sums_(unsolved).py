"""
You are given two arrays rowSum and colSum of non-negative integers where rowSum[i] is the sum of the elements in
the ith row and colSum[j] is the sum of the elements of the jth column of a 2D matrix.
In other words, you do not know the elements of the matrix, but you do know the sums of each row and column.

Find any matrix of non-negative integers of size rowSum.length x colSum.length that satisfies the rowSum and
colSum requirements.

Return a 2D array representing any matrix that fulfills the requirements.
It's guaranteed that at least one matrix that fulfills the requirements exists.
